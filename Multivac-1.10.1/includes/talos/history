Version 0.4 (2006-09-29)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Improved the management of dates.
   + Added 'Date::Date(string date)', 'Date::operator=(string date)' and
     'Date::SetDate(string date)' so that dates provided with strings can be 
     read with high flexibility.
   + Added comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != on dates.
   + Added 'Date::operator=(const Date&)'.
   + Added a copy constructor for 'Date'.
   + Added 'Date::GetSecondsFrom'.
   + Seconds in dates are now saved in a double precision variable.
- Added the ability to deal with sections in configuration files.
- Methods 'ExtStream::ExtStream(string, string, string)' and
  'ExtStream::Open(string, openmode)' now check that the file has been opened.
- In 'ExtStream' and 'ConfigStream', the files are now opened in binary mode so 
  that, under MS Windows, 'tellg' may not change the position in the stream.
- Changed 'fill(const string&, char, int, fmtflags)' into 'fill(const string&, 
  int, char, fmtflags)'.
- Changed the default alignment in 'fill' and 'to_str_fill' from right to left.

** Bug fixes:

- In 'Date::Adjust', negative months were not properly handled.
- In 'Date::Adjust', subtracting n seconds where n is a multiple of 60 did 
  not work.
- Fixed a bug in the detection of the end of a file.


Version 0.3 (2004-10-02)
-----------

** Improvements:

- Added 'ConfigStreams' to manage several configuration files as a single
  configuration file.
- Added the support of markup substitutions for configuration files.
- Talos now supports exceptions in 'ExtStream' and 'ConfigStream*', e.g. if
  an element is not found (method 'Find').
- Added methods:
   + ConfigStream::SetMarkupTags
   + ConfigStream::GetMarkupTags
   + ExtStream::FindFromBeginning
   + ExtStream::IsEmpty
   + ExtStream::SkipFullLines
   + ExtStream::SkipLines
   + ExtStream::SkipElements
   + ExtStream::SkipNumbers
- ExtStream now properly deals with booleans.
- Added methods:
   + Date::GetWeekDay
   + Date::GetNumberOfDays
   + Date::GetNumberOfHours
   + Date::GetNumberOfMinutes
   + Date::GetNumberOfSeconds
   + Date::Date()
- Added functions:
   + string fill(const string&, ...)
   + print(const vector<T>&)
   + split_markup
   + lower_case
   + upper_case
- Overloaded 'convert' to convert strings to booleans.

** Bug fixes:

- 'ExtStream::Rewind' failed if a previous operation on the stream
  failed, e.g. if EOF was read.
- In 'Date::Adjust': negative seconds and minutes were not well handled.
